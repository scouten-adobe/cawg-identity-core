//! Hopefully temporary implementation of COSE enveloped signatures
//! for W3C verifiable credentials.
//!
//! Based on reading [ยง3.3 With COSE] of [Securing Verifiable Credentials using
//! JOSE and COSE], candidate recommendation draft as of 05 July 2024.
//!
//! Quick-and-dirty adaptation from [`ssi` crate], which I hope will add its own
//! COSE support to replace this.
